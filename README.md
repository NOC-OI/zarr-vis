**Article:** [Zarr in the Browser â€” Fast, Flexible, and Surprisingly Powerful for Big Geo Data](https://medium.com/@tobias.ramalho.ferreira/zarr-in-the-browser-fast-flexible-and-surprisingly-powerful-for-big-geo-data-eeb90ddf8a3d)

## Overview

This project explores fast, scalable methods for visualizing **Zarr-based multidimensional data** directly in the browser. It evaluates server-side and client-side strategies and demonstrates them in a **Next.js application** built for interactivity and performance.

Zarr is a powerful format for storing chunked, compressed N-dimensional arrays, widely used in climate and oceanography. However, visualizing Zarr efficiently on the web has remained a challenge. This project implements and compares multiple approaches:

- Server-side dynamic tile rendering with [**titiler-multidim**](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler-multidim)
- Pure browser-side rendering using **WebGL + Mapbox**, inspired by [**carbonplan/maps**](https://github.com/carbonplan/maps)
- Pure browser-side rendering using **WebGL + Mapbox**, using [**zarr-gl**](https://github.com/carderne/zarr-gl)
- Optional rendering using Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and legacy WMS/WMTS tools like GeoServer

## Features

- Visualizes 10GB+ datasets interactively with smooth zoom/pan
- Supports time and depth slicing for 4D datasets
- Dynamically applies colormaps and enables pixel-level inspection
- Deploys in either static or server-backed modes
- Uses Zarr v2 with multiscale pyramids and consolidated metadata
- Generate canvas layers for animated visualizations (e.g., ocean currents)

## Datasets

The demo uses example outputs from the [**Near Present Day (NPD) NEMO ocean model**](https://github.com/NOC-MSM/NOC_Near_Present_Day) produced by the [National Oceanography Centre (NOC)](https://www.noc.ac.uk). These datasets are in Zarr format with curvilinear grids and multiple timesteps.

For full details on the preprocessing steps, including reprojection, rechunking, and pyramid generation, see the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@tobias.ramalho.ferreira/zarr-in-the-browser-fast-flexible-and-surprisingly-powerful-for-big-geo-data-eeb90ddf8a3d).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NOC-OI/zarr-vis.git
cd zarr-vis
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Update the environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference. You can see below an example of the required variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY=<SOME_API_KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TILE_SERVER_URL=https://imfe-pilot-tileserver.noc.ac.uk/
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZARR_TILE_SERVER_URL=https://atlantis44.xyz/
```

For the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY`, you can get a free API key by signing up at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5. (OPTIONAL) Add your own layers

To add your own layers, modify the `src/application/data/layers-json.tsx` file. You can add Zarr datasets or other compatible layers by following the existing format.

You can see below an example of a Zarr layer configuration:

```tsx
export const layersJson = {
  My_own_layers: { // This is the name of the group of layers that will appear in the frontend
    layerNames: {
      my_own_carbonplan_layer: { // Unique layer identifier that will be used in the code and frontend
        url: "https://atlantis-vis-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk/nemotest101/pyramid2/T1d/sos_abs.zarr", // URL to the Zarr dataset
        dataType: "carbonplan", // using carbonplan/maps
        content:
          "Some information about the dataset goes here.",
        params: {
          variable: "sos_abs" // variable name in the Zarr file
        },
        dimensions: { // the dimensions available in the dataset besides x and y. This is mandatory for carbonplan/maps
          time: {
            selected: 0, // default selected index
            values: 'range(1,152,1)' // can be an array of values or a range
          }
        },
        dataDescription: ['Salinity', ''], // The description of the data to show in the legend
        colors: 'jet', // colormap to use (from matplotlib colormaps)
        scale: [30, 37] // min and max values for the color scale
      },
      my_own_titiler_layer: { // Unique layer identifier that will be used in the code and frontend
        url: "https://atlantis-vis-o.s3-ext.jc.rl.ac.uk/nemotest101/T1d/sos_abs.zarr", // URL to the Zarr dataset
        dataType: "ZARR", // using titiler-multidim
        content:
          "Some information about the dataset goes here.",
        params: {
          variable: "sos_abs" // variable name in the Zarr file
        },
        dataDescription: ['Salinity', ''], // The description of the data to show in the legend
        colors: 'jet', // colormap to use (from matplotlib colormaps)
        scale: [30, 37] // min and max values for the color scale
      },
    }
  }
};
```

## Architecture

### Server-Side Tiling (Recommended for large datasets)

- Uses [**titiler-multidim**](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler-multidim) to dynamically generate tiles
- Deployed with FastAPI and auto-scaled via Knative (Kubernetes on JASMIN)
- Optional Redis caching layer for low-latency access

### Pure Client-Side (Static deployment)

- Streams Zarr tiles directly into WebGL via custom `<CarbonplanLayer>` for Mapbox GL JS
- Streams Zarr tiles directly into WebGL via `Zarr-gl` layer for Mapbox GL JS
- Uses multiscale pyramids built with [`ndpyramid`](https://github.com/carbonplan/ndpyramid)
- No server required â€” ideal for GitHub Pages or CDN deployment

### Baseline references

- GeoServer with NetCDF support was deployed in Kubernetes: Legacy Comparison
- Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) - converted the dataset to COG files, generating one COG per timestep and depth level.

## Data Preparation (Optional Workflow)

> Tools: `xarray`, `iris`, `ndpyramid`, `rasterio`, `xESMF`

1. Reproject to EPSG:4326 or EPSG:3857
2. Optimize chunking for web (e.g., `256x256` spatial-only chunks)
3. Build multiscale pyramids using `ndpyramid`
4. Save in Zarr v2 with `.zmetadata` consolidated
5. Optionally export to NetCDF or COG for legacy tools
